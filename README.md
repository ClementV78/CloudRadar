## 📌 Project Overview

**CloudRadar** is a **DevOps & Cloud Architecture showcase**: a lightweight AWS platform that runs a **queue-driven telemetry pipeline** (ingester → Redis list → consumers) on a minimal k3s stack. It emphasizes cost-efficient infrastructure choices, GitOps delivery, and operational readiness.

**Functional Overview:** Ingest live flight telemetry from OpenSky, aggregate events, and expose data for a map dashboard with alertable zones.

**Technical Overview:** Terraform provisions AWS (k3s on EC2, IAM, S3, VPC). GitHub Actions runs infra CI; ArgoCD syncs `k8s/apps`. Prometheus/Grafana observability and GHCR app publishing are planned.

**Project Management:**
All features and fixes are tracked as GitHub Issues and delivered through an iterative, issue-driven workflow. Progress is managed using a GitHub Projects Kanban board, following lightweight agile-inspired practices adapted for a solo project.

**Why this project exists:** provide a concrete, end-to-end DevOps/Cloud Architecture portfolio with real IaC, CI/CD, GitOps, and cost trade-offs.

| Helm | Manage charts via ArgoCD (e.g., EBS CSI) | Standard packaging for add-ons | Implemented (via ArgoCD) |
| k3s | Lightweight Kubernetes on EC2 | Low-cost, production-like K8s | Implemented |
| Prometheus + Grafana | Metrics collection and dashboards | Monitoring & observability by design | Planned |

## 🧩 DevOps Skills Demonstrated

| Skill | Evidence in this project |
| --- | --- |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform modules, remote state (S3 + DynamoDB) |
| GitOps Delivery | ArgoCD syncs `k8s/apps` to the cluster |
| CI for Infrastructure | GitHub Actions `fmt/validate/plan` with manual apply |
| Secure CI Access | IAM OIDC (no static AWS keys) |
| Cost Awareness | k3s on EC2 + NAT instance vs managed alternatives |
| Operational Readiness | Runbooks for bootstrap, verification, and ops |

This repository represents **Version 1 (MVP)** of the platform.

## 🎯 Technical Objectives

- Design a **budget-aware cloud architecture** on AWS
- Run Kubernetes **without managed control plane (EKS)** using **k3s on EC2**
- Implement a **queue-driven processing chain** (producer → Redis queue → consumers)
- Automate infra checks and delivery with **GitHub Actions** (infra CI live; app pipeline planned)

---

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture (v1)

![CloudRadar Architecture](./docs/architecture/cloudradar-v1-high-level.png)

**Key characteristics:**
- AWS Region: **us-east-1**
- Public Edge: **Nginx reverse proxy (EC2)** (dev implemented), **CloudFront** (planned)
- Private compute: **k3s cluster (2 EC2 nodes: 1 control plane + 1 worker)**
- Event buffering: **Redis**
- MVP storage: **SQLite (PV / EBS)**
- Observability (planned): **Prometheus & Grafana**
- Backups (planned): **Daily SQLite to Amazon S3**

---

## ☁️ AWS Infrastructure

High-level components (details in [docs/architecture/infrastructure.md](docs/architecture/infrastructure.md)):

| Component | Role | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VPC (public edge + private k3s) | Network segmentation and routing | Implemented |
| EC2 (Public) | Nginx reverse proxy + basic auth | Dev implemented |
| EC2 (Private) | k3s server + worker nodes | Implemented |
| NAT Instance | Private subnet egress | Implemented |
| CloudFront | Edge caching | Planned |
| S3 | Backups (daily) | Planned |
| VPC Endpoints (SSM, S3) | Private access to control/data plane | Dev implemented |

Infrastructure is provisioned with Terraform (networking, IAM, compute, storage).

---

## 🔄 CI/CD — GitHub Actions

Infra CI is live; app CI/CD is planned. Application workloads on k3s are reconciled by ArgoCD (GitOps) from `k8s/apps`.

1. A DevOps engineer pushes code or opens a pull request
2. **GitHub Actions (hosted runners)** validate infra (fmt/validate/plan + tfsec)
3. Infra changes are applied manually via workflow dispatch (controlled apply)
4. Application pipeline builds Docker images (planned)
5. Images are published to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** (planned)
6. ArgoCD syncs `k8s/apps` manifests to the k3s cluster (implemented)
7. The k3s cluster pulls images and runs updated workloads (planned)

---

## ☸️ Kubernetes Architecture (k3s)

The k3s cluster runs a **control plane** and **worker node(s)** on EC2, hosting all application workloads and platform components. ArgoCD manages workloads declaratively via GitOps.

### GitOps apps (`k8s/apps`)

ArgoCD syncs everything under `k8s/apps` automatically.

| App | Role | Namespace | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `health` | Minimal `/healthz` endpoint | `cloudradar` | Implemented |
| `redis` | Event buffer | `data` | Implemented |
| `ingester` | OpenSky ingestion | `cloudradar` | Implemented |
| `processor` | Redis aggregates | `cloudradar` | Implemented |
| `admin-scale` | Ingester scaling API | `cloudradar` | Implemented |
| `dashboard` | API + UI | `cloudradar` | Planned |

## 📈 Project Progress (Estimates)

| Release | Progress | Estimate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v1-mvp | `##############------` | 70% |
| v1.1 | `###-----------------` | 15% |
| v2 | `#-------------------` | 5% |

These are high-level estimates based on current scope.
Detailed status is tracked in [docs/project-status.md](docs/project-status.md) and in the GitHub Project board.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Runbooks)

Start here if you are setting up the project from scratch.

1. Follow the runbook order in [docs/runbooks/README.md](docs/runbooks/README.md).
2. Complete each runbook step-by-step (bootstrap → backend → live env).

---

## 🌿 Branching & Environments

- `main` is the single source of truth (not tied to a specific environment).
- Environment promotion uses IaC variables or `infra/live/*` layouts, not long-lived branches.

---

## ✅ Commit Conventions

- Use `type(scope): message` (same as issues).
- Link commits to issues with `Refs #<issue>` or `Fixes #<issue>`.

---

## 🚧 Roadmap

Planned future evolutions:

- Migration from SQLite to **managed database (RDS)**
- Advanced autoscaling scenarios (HPA, event-based scaling)
- GitOps evolution (ArgoCD app expansion, health sync) — Flux optional (planned)
- Improved security (secrets rotation)
